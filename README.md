# Automata Theory

> _The Automata Theory deals with the definitions and properties of the computation's mathematical models. These models are very important in many areas of the computer science. [...] The Automata Theory is excelent to start studying the computer theory and define what is a computer._ **(Michael, Sipser - Introduction to the Theory of Computation)**

This repository presents many models implementations built in Python, Julia and Rust, covering some models described in the book "Introduction to the Theory of Computation", by Michael Sipser.
